<span style="color:#7ac">  is a young Czech artist living in Prague,<br/>
working mainly with oil colors, she is also interested in multimedia technologies.<br/><br/>
   In her childhood  she was amazed by the world of fine art
and this strong impression also shaped her decision to became a painter.<br/><br/>
Taking inspiration from great artists as Dali,Bacon,Gauguin etc. unleashed her creativity,<br/>
allowing her to experiment with her own way of expression.<br/><br/>
She is fascinated  primarily by human figure and more  by inner human world. <br/>
Although her motifs in paintings are different ( portraits of musicians ,  elements and rituals
, wild  life...), in conclusion all of them are capturing  the moments of deep immersion,
rapture or revelation. These mentioned themes stream trough her work with certain
tranquility  and timelessness as a mirror of her intimate experiences.<br/><br/>
Leitá often describes her creative work more as alchemy than painting.<br/> Her canvas
becomes a melting pot filled with colors, shapes, found photographs, memories and insights,
all connected in an effective contrast which gives her paintings intensity.<br/><br/>
In the past she organized three exhibitions in Brno, two of them at
    Skleněná louka ( The twelve, Tibet ) and at the café Anděl ( The garden of the soul ).
